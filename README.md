# Task3-ConfigurationChange

Task: 
Implement the necessary methods in an Activity to handle configuration changes (like screen rotation) and preserve a counter. The Activity has a button that, when pressed, increments a counter. The current value of the counter should be displayed in a TextView and should not reset upon screen rotation.

Constraints:
The counter can range from 0 to a maximum of 1,000.
Only the screen rotation configuration change needs to be handled.
Output Format: The TextView should display the current counter value, updating every time the button is pressed. This value should persist across configuration changes.

Output Format:
